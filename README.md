# Data Structures in C

## Project Overview

This project is a collection of C code implementations for various fundamental data structures and sorting algorithms. It serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and understanding the core concepts and practical applications of these data structures.

## Features

The project encompasses the following data structures and algorithms:

**Data Structures:**

* **Linked Lists:**
    * Singly Linked List (insertion, deletion, traversal)
    * Doubly Linked List (insertion, deletion, traversal)
    * Circular Linked List (insertion, deletion, traversal)
* **Stacks:**
    * Stack using Arrays
    * Stack using Linked Lists
* **Queues:**
    * Queue using Arrays
    * Queue using Linked Lists
    * Circular Queue using Linked Lists
* **Trees:**
    * Binary Tree (traversal)
    * Binary Search Tree (insertion, deletion, search)
    * Minimum Heap Tree
    * Maximum Heap Tree

**Sorting Algorithms:**

* **Bubble Sort**
* **Insertion Sort**
* **Selection Sort**
* **Merge Sort**
* **Quick Sort**

**Search Algorithms:**

* **Linear Search**
* **Binary Search**

## Installation

This project does not use any environment managers or package managers. To use it, simply clone the repository and compile the individual C files.

## Usage

Each C file in the project represents a specific data structure or algorithm. To use a particular implementation:

1. **Compile the C file:**
   ```bash
   gcc <filename>.c -o <output_file> 
   ```
   For example, to compile `bubblesort.c`:
   ```bash
   gcc bubblesort.c -o bubblesort
   ```

2. **Run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./<output_file>
   ```
   For example, to run `bubblesort`:
   ```bash
   ./bubblesort
   ```

**Note:** You may need to modify the code to provide input data or print the desired output. 

This README provides a basic outline of the project's structure and usage. You can explore each C file individually for detailed implementation and usage instructions.
